## Side Quests
- Reading, journaling, thinking
- Sport climbing and bouldering… when I'm not injured
- Solo hiking, nothing too dangerous
- Playing bass (tried producing, but being a player feels way more me)
- Playing Texas Hold’em online
- Cooking soups

## Detours & Turns
- As a high schooler, I was fascinated by physics and uncertainty, and later wanted to become a VFX artist and direct music videos—storytelling through visuals (then statistics happened)
- Almost pursued forensic science, nearly worked at Judiciary Research Institute, but it didn’t feel right for this life
- Started learning French seriously right after my master’s thesis defense
- I swore to my parents I wouldn’t follow their path into medical science, but here I am believing it’s the right path for me

/Each of these paths, however different, was one I gave my full attention to at the time, and every experience has guided me toward the path I’m on today./
