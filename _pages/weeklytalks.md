A bi-weekly (sometimes weekly) series my friend (a CS student) and I started over half a year ago, where we discuss ideas or questions we encounter in daily life and share insights in 15–60 minute talks. Presentations slides are available via the links provided.

Talk01: Attention Is All You Need
-----
For my first talk, I chose to discuss what is considered one of the most important papers from the past 30 years: "[Attention Is All You Need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)." My friend isn’t exactly a fan of AI, but I felt it was essential to get them familiar with it. It’s a paper everyone should read at least once.

Talk02: A Story of an Antinomy
------
In this talk, I explore the endless antinomy between necessity and chance. Beginning from the end—with Schrödinger’s 1956 reflection—I trace how thinkers from ancient Greece to modern physics have sought to understand chance. The debates, the language, and our understanding of the world have changed, yet the antinomy remains. To grasp the role of chance, we have to look backward and see how people throughout history have thought about it. Most of the material in this talk is based on the book [The challenge of chance: A multidisciplinary approach from science and the humanities](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-26300-7).

Talk03: More Than Just a TOEFL Task
-----
While preparing for the TOEFL exam, I took a writing workshop where the teacher emphasized reasoning and critical thinking over grammar. He pointed out that many Iranian students, even at university, rarely practice structured reasoning through essay writing, which limits how we express ideas. This inspired me to read [“Critical Thinking: Your Guide to Effective Argument, Successful Analysis and Independent Study”](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/critical-thinking/book271969) by Tom Chatfield, and in this talk, I explore the TOEFL writing discussion task, the difference between uncritical and critical thinking, and how to identify and reframe common logical fallacies.

Talk04&05: Biomechanics of Wrist
-----
This talk explores the complex biomechanics of the wrist, inspired by injuries that both I and my friend's mom have experienced. I focus on two main parts: the bones and the ligaments, based on Chapter 7 of [Kinesiology of the Musculoskeletal System: Foundations for Rehabilitation](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/kinesiology-of-the-musculoskeletal-system/neumann/978-0-323-28753-1).

Talk06: Can You Read My Mind?
-----
This talk was inspired by the song [Read My Mind](https://youtu.be/zc8hbSM1zVo?si=L5pVHzKuoWQGq06e) by The Killers. The line “I never really gave up on breaking out of this two-star town…” has always made me think about exploring new paths, opportunities, and the longing to move beyond the city I live in. Building on that feeling, I reflect on the options and directions I’m considering for my PhD journey. Since this talk is quite personal, I won’t be sharing the slides publicly.

Talk07: Knot Theory
-----
Having just passed my knot‑tying exam as part of the sport climbing training course at [IMSCF](https://msfi.ir/), this talk is about the mathematics behind knots. To keep the talk short, I’ll focus on this most common climbing knot, the figure eight follow‑through.
