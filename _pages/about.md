👾 Hi! I’m Kosar, and I recently completed my master’s in Mathematical Statistics at the University of Tehran, where I worked on my thesis about causal discovery in longitudinal data from medical data, exploring how to make inferences more robust by carefully examining and relaxing underlying assumptions. 

With a strong background in mathematical statistics, I enjoy exploring how data, uncertainty, and structure come together to form meaningful conclusions. I’ve always been drawn to the idea of understanding the world through uncertainty. I’m also deeply interested in the philosophy and history of probability and statistics.

**Life's Twists, Turns, and Lessons**
As a high schooler, I was drawn to modern physics and the idea of uncertainty. I loved the logic of algebra and probability as much as the creative freedom of visual storytelling. I even spent a summer learning VFX, hoping to make music videos that expressed ideas through sound and image. When the pandemic arrived, my focus shifted fully to studying statistics, though I’ve come to realize these paths shared the same motive: making sense of complexity, whether through visuals or data.

Later, I nearly pursued forensic science before realizing I didn’t want to spend my life uncovering what went wrong but understanding what could go right. That shift gradually led me toward questions in health and uncertainty.

**Currently I'm looking for PhD opportunities in statistics or biostatistics.** If you’d like to get in touch, please don’t hesitate to contact me at my [email](kabdollahi99@gmail.com).
