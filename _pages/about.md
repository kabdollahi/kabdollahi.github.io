ðŸ‘¾ Hi! Iâ€™m Kosar, and I recently completed my masterâ€™s in Mathematical Statistics at the University of Tehran, where I worked on my thesis about causal discovery in longitudinal data from medical data, exploring how to make inferences more robust by carefully examining and relaxing underlying assumptions. 

With a strong background in mathematical statistics, I enjoy exploring how data, uncertainty, and structure come together to form meaningful conclusions. Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the idea of understanding the world through uncertainty. Iâ€™m also deeply interested in the philosophy and history of probability and statistics.


**Life's Twists, Turns, and Lessons**
- As a high schooler, I was fascinated by modern physics and the role of uncertainty.
- Later, I wanted to become a VFX artist and directing music videosâ€”telling stories through visuals.
- Almost pursued forensic science, nearly worked at the Judiciary Research Institute, but it didnâ€™t feel right for this life.
- I swore to my parents I wouldnâ€™t follow their path into medical science, but here I am believing itâ€™s the right path for me

Each of these experiences, though different, received my full attention and shaped my perspective. They have all guided me to the path I follow today. Somehow, that same curiosity led me to statistics. Iâ€™ve come to see it not just as a mathematical field, but as a way of thinking.

Currently I'm looking for PhD opportunities in statistics or biostatistics. If youâ€™d like to get in touch, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me at my [email](kabdollahi99@gmail.com).
