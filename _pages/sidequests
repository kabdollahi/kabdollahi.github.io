Side Quests

* Reading, journaling, thinking
* Sport climbing and bouldering… when I'm not injured
* Solo hiking, nothing too dangerous
* Playing bass (tried producing, but being a player feels way more me)
* Playing Texas Hold’em online, because why not
* Cooking soups

* Almost pursued forensic science, nearly worked at judiciary research institute, but it didn’t feel right
* Started learning French seriously right after my master’s thesis defense
